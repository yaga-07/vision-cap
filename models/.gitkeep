# Models Directory

This directory stores AI model weights locally.

## Model Storage Structure

- `insightface/` - InsightFace face recognition models
- `sentence_transformers/` - CLIP and other sentence transformer models
- `huggingface/` - HuggingFace transformers models (if used)

## Downloading Models

Models will be automatically downloaded on first run, or you can download them manually using:

```bash
# Download InsightFace models
python scripts/download_models.py

# Or download individually
python -c "from insightface.app import FaceAnalysis; FaceAnalysis(name='buffalo_l')"
python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('clip-ViT-B-32')"
```

## Clearing Models

To free up space, simply delete the contents of this directory:

```bash
# Remove all models (~2-3GB)
rm -rf models/*

# Or remove specific models
rm -rf models/insightface/
rm -rf models/sentence_transformers/
```

Models will be re-downloaded automatically on next startup if missing.
